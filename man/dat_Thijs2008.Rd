\title{Antiplatelet regimens for the prevention of serious vascular events after
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke}
\format{
A data frame with 300,000 rows and 7 columns:
\describe{
  \item{`Chain`}{The index of the chain.}
  \item{`Placebo`}{The sampled relative effects of placebo vs. placebo
  (should be 0).}
  \item{`ASA`}{The sampled relative effects of aspirin (ASA) vs. placebo.}
  \item{`ASADP`}{The sampled relative effects of aspirin + dipyridamol
  (ASA+DP) vs. placebo.}
  \item{`Thieno`}{The sampled relative effects of thienopyridines (Thieno)
  vs. placebo.}
  \item{`ThienoASA`}{The sampled relative effects of thienopyridines +
  aspirin (Thieno+ASA) vs. placebo.}

\description{
Samples from the joint distribution of the relative effects for each
active treatment (aspirin, aspirin + dipyridamole, thienopyridines,
thienopyridines + aspirin) vs. placebo estimated in a fixed effect Bayesian
network meta-analysis with a binomial likelihood and logit link. Three chains
were run, the first 50,000 samples were discarded as burn-in, and the
subsequent 100,000 samples (a total of 300,000 samples) were saved in this
data frame. The outcome is serious vascular events.
