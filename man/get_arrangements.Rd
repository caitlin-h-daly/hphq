\title{Get credible arrangement hierarchies}
\usage{
get_arrangements(hierarchy_matrix, threshold, order_by = c("Length", "Freq"))
}
\arguments{
\item{hierarchy_matrix}{a matrix where column headers are ranks and each row
displays the treatments assigned to each rank for that iteration.}

\item{threshold}{a proportion between 0 and 1 for which a hierarchy must be
observed in order to be credible.}

\item{order_by}{a character vector consisting of "Freq" and "Length" only,
indicating the desired order of the arrangements within types (i.e., ranked
permutations, permutations, ranked combinations, and combinations). Default
is to order by the number of treatments ("Length") in the arrangements,
followed by the relative frequencies ("Freq").}
}
\value{
A list of data frames containing the credible hierarchies for ranked
permutations, permutations, ranked combinations, and combinations.
}
\description{
`get_arrangements()` finds all ranked permutations, permutations, ranked
combinations, and combinations with relative frequencies greater than or
equal to a given threshold.
}
\details{
Note that the progress of the permutations compilation will be printed for
each permutation size. The user may suppress these messages using
`suppressMessages(get_arrangements())`.
}
\examples{
inputs <- prep_data(effects_matrix = dat_Thijs2008[, -1], reference = "Placebo", largerbetter = FALSE)
get_arrangements(hierarchy_matrix = inputs$hierarchy_matrix, threshold = 0.9)
}
