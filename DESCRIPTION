Description: This package implements an efficient computational approach (Tan et 
  al. 2024) that systematically compiles a comprehensive catalog of all highly 
  probable treatment questions (e.g., those with an empirical 
  probability exceeding 90%) that may be asked in the context of network 
  meta-analysis (NMA) or other situations where there is a joint distribution 
  of the relative effects between multiple (>2) treatments.
