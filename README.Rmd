`hphq` is an R package for producing all credible treatment hierarchies arising
from highly probable hierarchy questions. It was designed for network 
meta-analysis (NMA), but may be applied to other settings for which there is
a joint distribution of the relative effects between multiple (>2) treatment 
options.

Please refer to the vignette for a package demonstration.
